"ULTIMATE DESK PTE. LTD.","Omnidesk™ was founded with a free-spirited and an ambitious objective: to offer height adjustable standing desks at a revolutionary price, while leading the way for healthy-lifestyle conscious businesses.



The best ideas usually come in response to an important problem. Ours was simple: standing desks are too expensive. 



We were a bunch of small business owners/tech consultants cum retired gamers, and the ageing factor started to set in as we spend 18hrs at the desk daily. With all the hype of big companies out-fitting their offices with standing desks, we decided to try them for ourselves too. The costs however were so exorbitant and we were surprised how hard it was to find a decent standing desk that didn't require us to munch on bread and biscuits for the entire month. Even at those prices, choices and designs were also very limited. So where were the options?



Turns out the ergonomics industry is a niche market monopolized by just a couple of big companies that have been able to place extortionate markups on prices while profiting from consumers who have no other options. 



We started Omnidesk™ as a spinoff from our sister company - Aftershock PC to create an alternative. A Revolution. A disruption. 



By implementing a direct sales model, bringing design and R&D in-house, and bringing our signature Customer Service (from Aftershock PC and Prism+ sister companies) to engage with customers, we’re able to provide higher-quality, better aesthetic, more functional custom standing desks at a fraction of the going market price. 





""Why should a 1.5m tall person use the same standard-height desk as a 1.9m tall individual?""



 ""Why should healthier ergonomic alternatives be priced out-of-reach to the masses and only the affluent can afford them?"" 





Not all workspaces are created equal.



We believe everyone should have easy access and be able to afford a lifestyle-changing standing desk (or furniture) and even customize it to their needs. That goes from entrepreneurs with home offices, small businesses, students or just people who wants a standing desk at home for work or play.



Our straightforward mission: Bringing quality and affordable customisable ergonomics to the masses.",,"https://sg.indeed.com/cmp/Ultimate-Desk-Pte.-Ltd.","5","1","https://theomnidesk.com/","We are currently seeking a highly motivated and HR Assistant cum PA to join our team.

From money management, to risk management, to wealth accumulation, to property ownership journey and the topics of CPF, Income Tax, Banking Accounts and Credit Cards, we would like to consider ourselves to be subject matter experts!
We are actively recruiting people who are self-motivated and keen to build your own business, earning based on your hard work. If you are someone who is self-motivated, enjoys working in a collaborative team environment and keen to do meaningful work to help people, we want you!
Role of an Advisor
People are at the heart of what we do. Our consultants have 3 key responsibilities to our clients

 1. Reduce stress and worries on their wealth journey
 2. Achieve financial freedom in the most efficient manner
 3. Enable Happiness and more time with loved ones

At Planners Inc, we help our clients using the economics of personal wealth to ensure efficient allocation of their resources, while taking care of any “What-Ifs” that life throws at them, ultimately to get them to retirement as soon as possible.
What sets us apart?
Financial advisory is nothing new, but at Planners Inc, we pride ourselves as an agency that truly cares for our people, empowering our team to Do Well by Doing Good. Licensed on a proven platform with superior systems and processes put in place, our consultants can and have built successful, sustainable and enjoyable practices.
What support will you get?
We have a Winning Formula and our results don’t lie. Our people, environment, culture and standards have stood the test of time. To help you achieve your career and personal goals, our whole agency is here to back you up. Throughout your journey, you will receive mentorship and guidance to achieve mastery in financial planning and obtain your Certified Financial Planner certification.
Your personal development matters to us. We will provide you with the opportunities and resources not only to grow in your career, but also to grow as a person. Want to be at your child’s soccer game on a Tuesday afternoon, or travel to JB on weekdays to avoid the weekend jam? You decide! At Planners Inc, you take control of how and where you work.

          Job Description
          
        
        
         
           KPMG’s Forensic team has a stellar reputation for delivering high quality work in a time of crisis. Because of this, we are engaged to advise in complex situations, which will be a fantastic learning opportunity for you.
          
         
          All our consultants interact with our clients and learn about some of their business specifics. You will gain experience across most industries and become a better consultant because of this and your day to day work will be more interesting.
          
         
          Our team comes from a variety of diverse backgrounds and have different skill sets – there is always someone you can ask for advice and support. The overall Forensic department covers a wide range of services – ranging from disputes to, anti-money laundering to misconduct investigations and therefore you will always be exposed to something exciting.
         
          
          
         
          This role involves:
          
         
          Day to day, you will be working in project teams, independent, but supervised by more experienced colleagues – Managers, and Associate Directors. You will also supervise and advise more junior colleagues on their day to day tasks. Your tasks could include computer imaging, log file analysis, investigating computer artefacts, analysis of malware, briefing your colleagues and clients, and writing parts of reports.
          
         
          When incidents occur and clients request our help cannot be predicted, you will have to be flexible to accommodate the need to work out of office hours. We will always be mindful of your personal and family needs. Through KPMG’s “Take Charge” program, we provide you with the flexibility to set your working hours.
         
          
          
         
          What you will do?
          
         
          Digital Forensic analysis – imaging of computers and forensic analysis of mostly Windows computers to support primarily fraud and misconduct investigations. 
          Support eDiscovery engagements. 
          Support mobile device forensics.
         
          
          
         
         
          Technical skills
          
         
          Be able to use forensic software to identify, collect, preserve and analyse electronic data from laptops, desktops, servers, backup tapes and mobile devices; 
          Proficient working knowledge in evidence handling, chain-of-custody, acquisition techniques, analysis of digital evidence, forensic lab practices and procedures; 
          Ability to program in any popular language and troubleshoot programs. This will help you to automate some of the routine investigation tasks. If you have previous experience programming in languages such as C# or Python, or others, you should be able to translate the concepts after a brief training time. The expected programming proficiency is: take a list of input files with file properties, compare those against known good (e.g. well-known system files) or known bad and output the result. 
          Good understanding of Microsoft Windows and operating systems (OS). You should be able to understand the OS permission, forensic artefacts and their meaning, be able to review system security logs against a checklist. 
          Any certification in the field of computer forensics and/or e-discovery will be an advantage.
         
          
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          ⠀
          
        
        
         
           Interpersonal skills
          
         
          Time management. It is not uncommon to work on 2-3 projects at the same time. You should be able to understand priorities, be confident enough to clarify the priorities from senior team members and raise concerns if these are not achievable. 
          Presentation skills. You should be comfortable presenting your conclusions to your colleagues and answer questions. KPMG will provide presentation skills to improve. 
          Ability to write in plain English. Most projects end with a report presented to the client; you will be expected to write sections of the report on the areas you have worked on in plain (business) English. 
          Hunger for knowledge. Cyber security is a rapidly expanding knowledge. You will have to continuously learn both on the job and on your own. 
          Leading self. You should be able to work by yourself towards your mid-term and long-term career goals. Your senior peers will provide coaching and mentoring.

            TotalEnergies is a multi-energy company that produces and markets energies on a global scale: oil and biofuels, natural gas and green gases, renewables and electricity. Our 105,000 employees are committed to energy that is ever more affordable, clean, reliable and accessible to as many people as possible. Active in more than 130 countries, TotalEnergies puts sustainable development in all its dimensions at the heart of its projects and operations to contribute to the well-being of people.
          
          
          
            TotalEnergies Trading & Shipping (T&S), an international trading company, puts its expertise to use in the global energy markets. With its biomass blending and trading activity, TotalEnergies T&S is an active participant in the development of sustainable biofuels. Our maritime transport expertise also helps to reduce the carbon footprint of sea transportation and we recently announced the time chartering of new vessels equipped with LNG propulsion.
          
          
          
            TotalEnergies Gas and Power (TGP) is the trading arm of TotalEnergies in the field of low carbon energies (mainly gas, LNG and power). As such it operates in fast-evolving market dynamics influenced by internal and external factors that require constant adaptation and evolution. Uncertainties specific to the trading environment (volatility of prices, supply & demand mismatches) are coupled with those coming from the broader energy sector (climate change policies, changes in the energy mix, developments of new energy sources, etc). In such context TGP helps to ensure growth and profitability to a key segment of the business in order to reach the objective of Carbon Neutrality by 2050.

The volatility of the energy trading markets requires excellence in risk management and a culture of innovation. We are fully embracing the digital revolution.
          
          
            Our people flourish in an environment that promotes expertise, entrepreneurship spirit, agility and a purpose-driven culture, generating boundless opportunities to learn, grow and achieve collaborative success.

While we evolve in a demanding industry that requests to be always on the edge, we cultivate a friendly workplace where our people feel good, where team spirit and respect guide our daily routine, where the diversity of our people and their skills create a nourishing experience for all of us.

   Role Overview 
    Charles Taylor Adjusting / Richards Hogg Lindley is a service-based company and our prime objective is to provide an expedient, comprehensive and technically competent professional service in response to the instructions from national and international insurance companies to handle claims. We provide average adjusting services that cover all levels of loss - no matter how complex or large. Globally, we have the largest team of average adjusters to assist our clients. 
    The role is desk based where the average adjusters will incorporate their findings into adjustments of claims, compiled in a format which offers an objective and concise analysis of each loss. You will be receiving trainings on the fundamentals of marine insurance and insurance policies, assisting senior adjusters with interpretation of survey reports, etc. as part of cause analysis and costs assessment. This will involve the collating and analysis of claim supporting documents to validate the repair costs and provide settlement proposals by preparing an adjustment of claim in accordance with the terms and conditions of the insurance policies. You may be assigned or work with senior or other group office adjusting team. 
    Average adjusters are experts in marine insurance and law, who may be appointed by any party in a marine claim or dispute. Irrespective of the identity of the instructing party, the average adjuster is bound to act in an impartial and independent manner. By experience and training, average adjusters are therefore problem-solvers and mediators. 
    The duty of an average adjuster is to act fairly to all parties to the contract of insurance or contracts of carriage, to set down all relevant material facts, to present the figures of the suggested settlement in such a manner as to be capable of being easily grasped, and above all, in all cases wherever definite law or practice is not clear, to place the matter before the parties interested in such a manner as to facilitate an settlement agreement between them. 
    With the progression of career, the right candidate may have the opportunities to spend some time working in our UK/Middle East/Greater China offices. 
    Charles Taylor Adjusting / Richards Hogg Lindley is committed to the development of the next generation of average adjusters. Our goal is to provide the successful candidate with market leading training for a successful career in average adjusting. We fully support our average adjusters to obtaining professional qualification from the UK Association of the Average Adjusters. We offer hybrid working and a modern office environment. 
    Key Responsibilities 
    1. To perform a loss adjusting function in respect of new claims and those already handled in the offices which have been delegated by directors or senior adjusters. This will involve, but not be limited to: - 
   
    Receiving and acknowledging new claims instructions.
    
   
    Managing and coordinating claims in a timely and professional manner within agreed Service Level Agreements.
    
   
    Undertaking meeting with Insurers, Reinsurers, Brokers, Claimants, Insureds and other interested parties as required.
    
   
    Preparing preliminary reports commenting in detail on all aspects of the claim including legal and policy liability considerations, potential quantum and future actions.

   <h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Role Overview</b></h2> 
   <p> Charles Taylor Adjusting / Richards Hogg Lindley is a service-based company and our prime objective is to provide an expedient, comprehensive and technically competent professional service in response to the instructions from national and international insurance companies to handle claims. We provide average adjusting services that cover all levels of loss - no matter how complex or large. Globally, we have the largest team of average adjusters to assist our clients.</p> 
   <p> The role is desk based where the average adjusters will incorporate their findings into adjustments of claims, compiled in a format which offers an objective and concise analysis of each loss. You will be receiving trainings on the fundamentals of marine insurance and insurance policies, assisting senior adjusters with interpretation of survey reports, etc. as part of cause analysis and costs assessment. This will involve the collating and analysis of claim supporting documents to validate the repair costs and provide settlement proposals by preparing an adjustment of claim in accordance with the terms and conditions of the insurance policies. You may be assigned or work with senior or other group office adjusting team.</p> 
   <p> Average adjusters are experts in marine insurance and law, who may be appointed by any party in a marine claim or dispute. Irrespective of the identity of the instructing party, the average adjuster is bound to act in an impartial and independent manner. By experience and training, average adjusters are therefore problem-solvers and mediators.</p> 
   <p> The duty of an average adjuster is to act fairly to all parties to the contract of insurance or contracts of carriage, to set down all relevant material facts, to present the figures of the suggested settlement in such a manner as to be capable of being easily grasped, and above all, in all cases wherever definite law or practice is not clear, to place the matter before the parties interested in such a manner as to facilitate an settlement agreement between them.</p> 
   <p> With the progression of career, the right candidate may have the opportunities to spend some time working in our UK/Middle East/Greater China offices.</p> 
   <p> Charles Taylor Adjusting / Richards Hogg Lindley is committed to the development of the next generation of average adjusters. Our goal is to provide the successful candidate with market leading training for a successful career in average adjusting. We fully support our average adjusters to obtaining professional qualification from the UK Association of the Average Adjusters. We offer hybrid working and a modern office environment.</p> 
   <p><b> Key Responsibilities</b></p> 
   <p> 1. To perform a loss adjusting function in respect of new claims and those already handled in the offices which have been delegated by directors or senior adjusters. This will involve, but not be limited to: -</p>

 Save the Children is the world’s leading independent organization for children, working in 117 countries with more than 25,000 staff. In April 2020, Save the Children launched the Center for Utilizing Behavioral Insights for Children (CUBIC) in Asia. CUBIC is the first “nudge unit” in the world to focus specifically on the most marginalized children’s rights and welfare. Our goal is to apply behavioral science in order to reach more children and have an even greater impact on their lives. 
 Projects 
 CUBIC is currently seeking a Master’s (or Ph. D.) level intern(s) to support its projects during the summer of 2024, including, but not restricted to:

  Analytical work
