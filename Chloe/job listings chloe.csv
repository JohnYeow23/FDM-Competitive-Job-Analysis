Amazon - Australia,Amazon Expression of Interest,"Amazon Expression of Interest for Students & Graduates in Australia and New Zealand
Amazon’s mission is to be Earth's most customer-centric company. Our actions, goals, projects, programs, and inventions begin and end with the customer top of mind. By working together on behalf of our customers, we are building the future one innovative product, service, and idea at a time.
Amazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. We are driven by the excitement of building technologies, inventing products, and providing services that change lives. We embrace new ways of doing things, make decisions quickly, and are not afraid to fail. We have the scope and capabilities of a large company, and the spirit and heart of a small one.
What unites all Amazonians (across teams and locations) is that we are all striving to delight our customers and make their lives easier—whoever that customer may be (e.g., consumers, business owners, content creators, employees, etc.). In pursuit of delighting customers, Amazonians have developed many products and services that have transformed the way our customers live their lives and run their businesses
You'll also hear us say that at Amazon, it's always ""Day 1."" What do we mean? That our approach remains the same as it was on Amazon's very first day - to make smart, fast decisions, stay nimble, invent, and focus on delighting our customers.
Why join us?
Amazon is an innovation company, where it's always ""Day 1"".
We live our 16 leadership principles every day and everything we do is framed by these principles. If you are looking to grow professionally at a fast pace, this is a great place to be!
You’re surrounded by innovation
Whether it’s delivering packages in under 24 hours, enabling entrepreneurs to grow their businesses with AWS, or creating great shows to binge watch on a Sunday afternoon, we know that delighting customers requires a lot of innovation.
Sometimes that innovation takes the form of small incremental improvements on existing processes, and sometimes it starts with a blank white board and a random idea.
Your growth is accelerated
Many people say that they learn more at Amazon in their first six months than they learned in the first two years at other companies. This is due to the scope, scale, speed, and impact of the projects that people are a part of, as well as the remarkable colleagues that they work with every day.
Amazonians are also encouraged to experiment with new possibilities, take risks, learn quickly, and manage constraints by looking for ways to accomplish more with less.
You have a voice here and are encouraged to use it
Put very simply, we want to hear what you have to say. Good ideas can’t lead to great products, services, or solutions if you don’t vocalize them. And we strongly believe that the best outcomes come from embracing a variety of perspectives, so at Amazon, we really embrace individual expression, show respect for different opinions, and work together to create a culture where each of us is able to contribute fully.
Our unique backgrounds and perspectives strengthen our ability to achieve Amazon’s mission of being Earth’s most customer-centric company.
The work is challenging
The scope and scale of what we do to delight customers is pretty challenging. It requires Amazonians to be resourceful and embrace a high degree of change and ambiguity, while still meeting the high standards that we set for ourselves. Building and delivering things that were never thought possible isn’t easy and Amazonians often find themselves trying to figure out the right path forward without a playbook to tell them what to do.
You’re empowered with a lot of ownership
One of the most common things we hear from Amazonians is that they love how much ownership and responsibility they have from the very beginning. The size and scope of what they work on is bigger than they expected coming in. The degree of ownership does differ from role to role, but Amazonians consistently report having much more ownership of their work here than at their previous employers.
Your experience and career development is in your hands

We live our 16 leadership principles every day and everything we do is framed by these principles. If you are looking to grow professionally at a fast pace, this is a great place to be!
You’re surrounded by innovation
Whether it’s delivering packages in under 24 hours, enabling entrepreneurs to grow their businesses with AWS, or creating great shows to binge watch on a Sunday afternoon, we know that delighting customers requires a lot of innovation.
Sometimes that innovation takes the form of small incremental improvements on existing processes, and sometimes it starts with a blank white board and a random idea.
Your growth is accelerated
Many people say that they learn more at Amazon in their first six months than they learned in the first two years at other companies. This is due to the scope, scale, speed, and impact of the projects that people are a part of, as well as the remarkable colleagues that they work with every day.
Amazonians are also encouraged to experiment with new possibilities, take risks, learn quickly, and manage constraints by looking for ways to accomplish more with less.
You have a voice here and are encouraged to use it
Put very simply, we want to hear what you have to say. Good ideas can’t lead to great products, services, or solutions if you don’t vocalize them. And we strongly believe that the best outcomes come from embracing a variety of perspectives, so at Amazon, we really embrace individual expression, show respect for different opinions, and work together to create a culture where each of us is able to contribute fully.
Our unique backgrounds and perspectives strengthen our ability to achieve Amazon’s mission of being Earth’s most customer-centric company.
The work is challenging
The scope and scale of what we do to delight customers is pretty challenging. It requires Amazonians to be resourceful and embrace a high degree of change and ambiguity, while still meeting the high standards that we set for ourselves. Building and delivering things that were never thought possible isn’t easy and Amazonians often find themselves trying to figure out the right path forward without a playbook to tell them what to do.
You’re empowered with a lot of ownership
One of the most common things we hear from Amazonians is that they love how much ownership and responsibility they have from the very beginning. The size and scope of what they work on is bigger than they expected coming in. The degree of ownership does differ from role to role, but Amazonians consistently report having much more ownership of their work here than at their previous employers.
Your experience and career development is in your hands
Amazonians are required to chart their own path by driving their own development, career, and future at Amazon.

Why? 
Why this matters to us
BELONGING WITHOUT CONFORMING 
Inclusion should embrace the diversity within a workforce, not absorb away the differences. We’ve felt the benefits of this at Wiley Edge HQ.  So we want to keep doing our bit to drive change, from sharing our own struggles and victories to doing away with dress codes. 
MAKING MERITOCRACY WORKABLE
“Equality of opportunity” is easy to talk about but hard to put into practice. We recognize that positive action is sometimes needed when a person’s background might hold them back, despite their aptitudes. 
VALUE IN DIFFERENCE
By helping under-represented groups excel in jobs they might not have chosen unaided, organizations gain new thinking, new ideas, and new ways of solving problems.  
How? 
We hire graduates with the potential, passion, and practical degrees to succeed in your teams. 
We train them at Wiley Edge Academy. Aligned to industry, our curriculum adapts to meet ever-changing requirements.
We deploy them onsite with you for 12 to 24 months, supporting their skills development throughout.

Jane Street - Australia,Rotational Development Program - Full Time,"About the Position
We are looking for Analysts to join our Rotational Development Program (RDP). This is a full-time position that prepares you for a key cross-departmental role at Jane Street. During the initial program, you’ll spend your first year rotating through 3-5 Infrastructure subgroups—including Compliance, Finance, Operations, Risk, and more—before being placed in a home group that matches your interests and our needs.
During each of your rotations, you’ll work on projects that help you understand what each group does and what problems it helps solve within Jane Street. These projects can involve analyzing data, finding and solving bottlenecks in existing processes, and integrating new initiatives into our operational, regulatory, and technical infrastructure. 
This role combines big-picture project management with deep dives into detailed workflows, and the goal is to help you develop a comprehensive understanding of Jane Street’s business. Over time, your work will evolve from small pieces of larger initiatives to group-specific process improvements, and eventually to projects with implications for many groups across our firm.
If you’d like to learn more, you can read about our interview process and meet some of our newest hires.
About You
We don’t expect you to have a background in finance or any other specific field—we’re looking for smart people who enjoy solving interesting problems. We’re more interested in how you think and learn than what you currently know. You should be:
Excited to engage with diverse topics in finance, technology, and the law
Interested in developing a broad range of technical skills, from working with and analyzing data, to understanding and writing code
Able to evaluate processes and create informed, concrete proposals; and to proactively lead those proposals from start to finish
Proactive, reliable, and courteous with strong organizational, interpersonal, and communication skills
Eager to ask questions, admit mistakes, and constantly deepen your understanding
Fluent in English"

We are looking for Quantitative Researchers to help us build models, strategies, and systems that price and trade a variety of financial instruments.

Since our models leverage both our powerful internal technology and a deep understanding of the markets, we expect our Researchers to collaborate closely with our Software Engineers and Quantitative Traders. In this role, you’ll work together to identify market signals, analyze large datasets, build and test models, create new strategies, and write the code that implements them. 
The problems we work on rarely have clean, definitive answers. You should be comfortable pushing in new and unknown directions while maintaining clarity of purpose. We believe great solutions come from the interaction between diverse groups of people across the firm. The role you carve out for yourself over time will be largely dependent on your strengths and the types of problems you enjoy thinking about.

A profitable trading strategy is only as strong as the technology it runs on, and we consider ourselves as much a technology company as a trading firm. While exposure to a particular programming language is not required, general programming experience is a plus.

Jane Street - Australia,Software Engineer - Full Time,"About the Position
We’re looking for Software Engineers who want to help us design and build the systems and tools that run the firm. You’ll find Software Engineers in all parts of Jane Street, solving real problems in critical areas ranging from trading desks to our accounting team, as well as building foundational infrastructure, whether that means implementing network monitoring or risk models. We are big believers in functional programming, and use OCaml as our primary development language (we have the largest team of OCaml developers in any industrial setting). 
Beyond our own environment, we also recognize the value of open source software, leveraging it in our daily work and releasing hundreds of thousands of lines of our own code as open source. We’re also always looking for ways to expand open source projects, and provide ongoing support to things like Mercurial, the OCaml compiler, and the OPAM package manager. That said, we’re interested in talented engineers with experience in any language—most of us came in with little to no practical experience in OCaml before we joined.
