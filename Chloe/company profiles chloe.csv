What unites all Amazonians (across teams and locations) is that we are all striving to delight our customers and make their lives easier—whoever that customer may be (e.g., consumers, business owners, content creators, employees, etc.).

Amazon has 13 affinity groups, also known as employee resource groups, which bring Amazon employees together across businesses and locations around the world. Some examples include the Women@Amazon, Amazon Women in Engineering (AWE), Indigenous@Amazon, Glamazon, Asians@Amazon to name a few! 
We bring varying backgrounds, ideas, and points of view to inventing on behalf of our customers. Our diverse perspectives come from many sources including gender (cis, trans, identity, expression), race, ethnicity, age, national origin, sexual orientation, disability, culture, education, professional and life experience, age, and the intersections of these and other factors. 
Our Affinity Groups bring employees together across businesses and geographies. With executive and company sponsorship, these groups play an important role in building internal networks for career development, advising Amazon business units, leading in service projects, participating in policy discussions, and reaching out to communities where Amazonians live and work. Since 2016, enrollment in Amazon’s affinity groups has more than doubled in more than 90 chapters worldwide. Visit our Diversity & Inclusion page to learn more
We believe that every Amazonian should feel comfortable sharing their unique perspectives, and every Amazonian should seek out the perspectives of others. This is ingrained in our leadership principles that guide our company. For example, Are Right, A Lot notes that leaders must seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm our own beliefs. This kind of inclusive behavior increases the likelihood that we will be right (a lot) and have the information and insights needed to invent on behalf of all of Amazon’s customers—rather than just a limited subset. 
At Amazon, we don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term gain. Promoting inclusion and diversity is both a short and long-term investment, which is why we are committed to hiring the best talent of all backgrounds, creating a culture of inclusion at Amazon every day, and growing the next generation of leaders by providing young leaders in underrepresented communities with training in science, technology, engineering, and math. 
Amazon organizes events and programming to celebrate the importance of diversity and inclusion.
